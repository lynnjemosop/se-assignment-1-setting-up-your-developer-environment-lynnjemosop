# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.


#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
    I checked if Windows 11 is ready for your device.
      I then selected Start  
      Then to the Settings  
      clicked Update & Security  
      Then Windows Update  
       Checked for updates.
       Update

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   
 1.  Go to the VS Code Website:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
Open your web browser and go to the Visual Studio Code website.

Select Your Operating System:
The website will automatically detect your operating system and provide the appropriate download button.
Alternatively, you can manually select for windows.
Download the Installer:
Click the download button to start downloading the installer for windows.

2. Install Visual Studio Code
For Windows:
Run the Installer:
Locate the downloaded VSCodeUserSetup-x64-<version>.exe file and double-click it to run the installer.
Setup Wizard:
Follow the prompts in the setup wizard. Accept the license agreement, choose the installation location, and select additional tasks if needed (such as adding VS Code to the PATH).

Install
Click the Install button to begin the installation process.
Once the installation is complete, you can choose to launch VS Code immediately.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
 Install Git
Windows:

Download the Git Installer:
Go to the Git for Windows website.
Click the download link to get the latest version of the Git installer.

Run the Installer:
Double-click the downloaded .exe file to run the installer.
Follow the setup wizard prompts. 

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
Visit the official Python website (www.python.org) and download the right version for your windows

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. This typically involves selecting a destination folder for Python and choosing whether to add Python to your PATH environment variable.

Verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal window and typing "python" followed by enter. If the installation was successful, you should see the Python interpreter start up and display the version number.
5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   Download the script, from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py.

Open a terminal/command prompt, cd to the folder containing the get-pip.py file and run:

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   
 1.  I Downloaded the latest version from the official website, https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder and run the installer.
4. Follow the prompts to set up your database.
5. Once the installation is complete, you can start using MySQL.
6. Download other mysql databases like mysql server, workbench and shell
 
7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
